# Automator-Services

A simply Automator script for macOS. For use when you want to paste into a box that doesn't simply let you use command + v.
To install:
  1. Place the workflow file in ~/Library/Services
  2. In enable the service in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts
  
To use simply instead of pushing command + v where you normally would, go to "Application Name" -> Services in the Menu bar and select the service.

Alternatively you can also set a shortcut in the same place you activated it but I've had issues with it working.
